You are given an integer n. If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, 
print "Divisible by 3 and 5". If it is divisible only by 3, print "Divisible by 3". 
If it is divisible only by 5, print "Divisible by 5". Otherwise, print "Not Divisible".

Test cases:
1) input : 15     output: Divisible by 3 and 5
2) input : 5      output: Divisible by 5
3) input : 7      output: Not Divisible
4) input : 9      output: Divisible by 3 
5) input : -30    output: Divisible by 3 and 5
